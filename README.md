### Description

With this control, all you need to do is drop it on your form, and then ANYTHING on your form that is pruple will become transparent. This would be a useful tool for created custom shaped forms. On the example form provided, I have set a command button, label, frame control, text box, and shape control to purple, so they become transparent, incase you somehow got confused on how to use this.
